# Getting Started

## The Angular CLI

Although you technically can start an Angular project by manually creating files and installing each dependency, it's *HIGHLY* recommended that you use the Angular CLI tool.

The Angular CLI is simply a command line tool which helps create and manage your Angular project throughout the development process.

Between the three major frameworks, React, Vue.js and Angular, Angular's CLI is arguably the most useful. This is simply because the Angular CLI isn't predominantly used for initializing a new project. It's also frequently used to add additional architectural parts of your project, too.

## Install the CLI

If you haven't already, install the Angular CLI in your terminal with:

```zsh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
