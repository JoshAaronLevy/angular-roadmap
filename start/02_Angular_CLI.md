# Using the Angular CLI

Now that you have installed the Angular CLI, let's go ahead and create your new project.

For this tutorial, we're going to create an online bookstore. If you learn best by following a code-along, just use the commands and code examples provided. You can even view the [Angular Bookstore](https://github.com/JoshAaronLevy/angular-bookstore) GitHub repository used as the companion repo for this guide.

However, if you learn best by using your own project idea, that's perfectly fine. You can still use the same commands and the same coding principles in this guide, modified to your creative endeavor.

## Starting a Project

To start a new project with the Angular CLI, we'll use the `ng new` command in terminal, like this:

```zsh
ng new angular-bookstore
```
